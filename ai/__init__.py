"""
This file makes the 'ai' folder a Python package.

Without this __init__.py file, Python wouldn't recognize this directory as a package,
and imports like 'from ai.ai_logic import get_ai_response' would fail.

This file can be empty - its presence is what matters. An empty __init__.py is 
perfectly fine and is a common practice in Python projects. You could optionally add
import statements here to make module imports more convenient elsewhere in the project.
